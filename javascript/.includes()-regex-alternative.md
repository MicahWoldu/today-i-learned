<h3> String.prototype.includes() - A Handy Alternative to RegEx.test() and RegEx.replace() </h3>

Whilst I was still getting familiar with RegEx I found this extremely useful.

It's capabilities go beyond what MDN and w3schools' definitions suggest. "This method lets you determine whether or not a string includes another string."

General syntax:       ```       string.includes(searchvalue,start)       ```

Example:
```javascript
var str = "Hello world, welcome to codingforeveryone.";
var n = str.includes("world", 12);
```
This checks if a string includes "world" starting at position 12. "world" occurs later so it returns ```false```. 

<h4>The Good Part</h4>

If used differently, .includes() can be used to search a string for <strong>multiple</strong> characters. By creating an array 
which includes all the characters you wish to search for and passing. 

```javascript
var vowels = ["A","a","E","e","I","i", "O", "o", "U", "u"];
var string = "Hello world!";
for(var i = 0; i < string.length; i++){
  if (vowels.includes(string[i])) {
    string= string.replace(string[i], "");
  }
}
```
