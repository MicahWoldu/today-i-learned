<h3> String.prototype.includes() - A Handy Alternative to RegEx.test() and RegEx.replace() </h3>

Whilst I was still getting familiar with RegEx I found this extremely useful.

It's capabilities go beyond what MDN and w3schools' definitions suggest. "This method lets you determine whether or not a string includes another string."

General syntax:       ```       string.includes(searchvalue,start)       ```

Example:
```javascript
var str = "Hello world, welcome to codingforeveryone.";
var n = str.includes("world", 12);
```
This checks if a string includes "world" starting at position 12. "world" occurs later so it returns ```false```. 

<h4>The Good Part</h4>

If used differently, .includes() can be used to search a string for <strong>multiple</strong> characters. This can be done by creating an array which includes all the characters you wish to search for and then using an if statement inside a for loop. 

```javascript
var vowels = ["A","a","E","e","I","i", "O", "o", "U", "u"];
var string = "Hello world!";
for(var i = 0; i < string.length; i++){                             ---> "Hll wrld!"
  if (vowels.includes(string[i])) {
    string= string.replace(string[i], "");
  }
}
```
The for loop scans the string and the if statement executes when that position in the string contains <strong>any</strong>character inside our array. 

The scope is large as 1) We can enter any character into our array to search for. 2) We can also create multiple arrays of 'searchvalues' with extended if statements in order to perform different actions on different classes of characters. 

Note: If we want to perform an action all characters <i>excluded</i> from this array... we simple use ```!```.
```javascript  
if (!vowels.includes(string[i])) 
```
